    <h1>Gwalior Fort: The pearl among the fortresses of Hind</h1><br>
    <h5>01 Oct 2019</h5><br>

    <p>Madhya Pradesh is commonly known as the 'Heart of India', an epithet that perfectly suits a state located geographically and historically in the very centre of the country. And this beautiful Heart of Incredible India is adorned with magnificent forts and palaces, walls and corridors of which time-travel its tourists to the bygone era. <br> Recognised as one of the most impregnable forts in India is the Gwalior fort, described by the Mughal emperor Babur as 'the pearl among the fortresses of Hind'. Its 10 m high walls, rising sharply on a hill above the royal city of Gwalior contain some of the most magnificent sculptures and architecture.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>History of the Gwalior fort</h3>
    <br>
    <p>According to historians, the earliest foundation of Gwalior Fort may have been laid in the 6th century AD by Suraj Sen, a Rajput warrior. A fascinating story of Gwalior says that a saint named Gwalipa came wandering to the fort and met the king, who was suffering from a skin disease. When Gwalipa suggested him to take a dip in the sacred pond (now called Suraj Kund), the king was immediately cured. And in gratitude, Suraj Sen named the city Gwalior after the sage. <br> After being attacked and ruled by various rulers, the Tomars captured the fort in 1398. The most celebrated of the Tomars was Maan Singh. He was the one who constructed several monuments inside the fort complex. The beautiful turquoise blue-tiled Man Mandir Palace was also built during his reign. <br> After the Tomars, the Mughals ruled Gwalior. With the decline of the Mughals, Marathas, specifically the Schindias ruled Gwalior until the early 19th century. The last assault upon this great fort was led by legendary freedom fighters, the valiant queen of Jhansi and Tantiya Tope during the battle of 1857. <br> Today, the fort's existing history lives on in its palaces, temples, gateways and its walls. If you want to relive the great battles, brave dynasties and epic stories, you must plan a visit to the exquisite masterpiece in the heart of Incredible India, Gwalior Fort. </p><br>

    <p>The Gurudwara is a memorial of the 6th Sikh Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji. According to legends, the Sikh Guru with 52 kings was imprisoned for about two years in the Gwalior Fort. When the Mughal emperor Jehangir decided to free the Guru, he insisted that the kings imprisoned with him should also be freed. Hence, a Gurudwara was built inside the fort to commemorate the event.</p>
