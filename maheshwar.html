    <h3>Rajwada</h3>

    <p>Among the most significant of Ahilya Bai's buildings in Maheshwar is Rajwada or the royal residence. Inside the palace is the throne room with Rajgaddi on which the sari clad life size statue of Devi Ahilyabai Holkar is placed. It was this place from where Devi Ahilyabai used to dispense justice.  During her reign Maheshwar became important on the political and commercial front. The Ahilya fort on the other hand, is turned into a heritage hotel offering stunning views of the river Narmada. A double storeyed gateway, directly opposite the main entrance to the Rajwada, leads to a flight of steps that brings one closer to the Narmada ghat. It is from this gateway that one can see the panoramic views from the ghats. On waking up early in the morning, one can take a long walk on the river bank, witness the sunrise and the activities that are a part of the locals here. They take a dip in the holy river Narmada and the boat man can be seen taking the tourists for a boat ride across the Narmada ghat.</p><br>
